Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 10 rows and 11 columns.
MIP Presolve modified 7 coefficients.
Aggregator did 3 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.16 sec. (0.03 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.19 sec. (0.03 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.19 sec. (0.03 ticks)


Feasibility condition is satisfied for commodity 1


Total demand is less than total capacity for commodity 1
Total demand for commodity 1 is : 1400.0
Total capacity for commodity 1 is : 2700.0


Solution status = Optimal


Total Cost is = 968282.0877033926
---> Total Transportation Cost is = 6882.087703392572
---> Total Fixed Cost is = 960000.0
---> Total Marginal Cost is = 1400.0
